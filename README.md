# ContractAdvisor-RAG

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for contract-related Question and Answer (Q&A) tasks. Our ultimate goal is to build the first fully autonomous artificial contract lawyer capable of drafting, reviewing, and negotiating contracts without human assistance.

## Key Objectives:
- Build a Contract-Optimized Q&A System
- Evaluate and Improve the RAG System



## Tasks:
- Build a Simple Q&A Pipeline with RAG Using Langchain
- Build a RAG Evaluation Pipeline with RAGAS
- Integrate Microsoft AutoGen
- Optimize the Contract Q&A System
